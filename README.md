# SyncSentinelRules
Synchronizes rules synced to the local machine from the github Sentinel repo. 

RulesImporter is a wizard interface that parses the local github repo synced from the MS Sentinel repo. It parses the local folder for "Detections" then sends them to the workspace that you specify. A powershell version is in the works.
